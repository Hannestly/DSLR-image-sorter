# Image file sorter

Don't hassle sorting out JPG files from CR2 files. We have computer for that.

## What does 'sort.py' do?
Sort.py first checks to see if there are folders called 'JPG' and 'CR2'. If they do not exist, Sort.py will create the two folders for you.

Next, Sort.py will proceed to sorting out JPG files and insert them into 'JPG' folder and vice versa for the CR2 files. Simple!

## Quick start
1. clone/download sort.py 
2. move sort.py file into the directory containing JPG and CR2 files
3. run sort.py
